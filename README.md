# Master-Node

We have been working on Home Automation for our finaly year project of Btech.
our aim is for voice recognized automation. We were successful, but the number of devices were a constraint as the project was a wired one.
We shifted to wireless communication. This is the code for Master Node, which controls all the Slave nodes where the to-be devices will be connected.
The Master Node keeps data of the connected Slaves and also interracts with Android Application which acts as a UI.

Currently, wireless communication has been completed. The voice recognition needs to be integrated.

An ESP32 Module acts as Master Node. It has both WiFi and SoftAP capabilities which out project relies on.
